### Description

Sentiment analysis is an advanced analysis technique that uses machine learning. It's also another good way to get in depth results about the data. Sentiment analysis looks specifically at the feeling implicit in the comment. This could be positive, negative, or neutral.

When you know the sentiment present in your app reviews, you are then able to understand what your customers are happy with and what they are not, i.e. what you should improve or change.

In the case of negative sentiment, you can often turn around bad situations or avoid them all together when you collect this feedback and act on it in a timely manner. Positive sentiment can help you see where you are pleasing your customers and what you could do more of. It can also give you a sense of the urgency of the review and if it's something that needs to be dealt with urgently to avoid future issues.

Your task is to develop an application to determine the sentiment of the reviews given in e-commerce application (say amazon) and then classify them into various categories. The main aim of this application is to aid the e-commerce websites to handle the reviews and take measures for improvement of the website.
