Tag: `Medium`

### Description
Sentiment analysis is an advanced analysis technique that uses machine learning. It's also another good way to get in depth results about the data. Sentiment analysis looks specifically at the feeling implicit in the comment. This could be positive, negative, or neutral.

When you know the sentiment present in your app reviews, you are then able to understand what your customers are happy with and what they are not, i.e. what you should improve or change.

In the case of negative sentiment, you can often turn around bad situations or avoid them all together when you collect this feedback and act on it in a timely manner. Positive sentiment can help you see where you are pleasing your customers and what you could do more of. It can also give you a sense of the urgency of the review and if it's something that needs to be dealt with urgently to avoid future issues.

Your task is to develop an application to determine the sentiment of the reviews given in e-commerce application (say amazon) and then classify them into various categories. The main aim of this application is to aid the e-commerce websites to handle the reviews and take measures for improvement of the website.

### Description

Microservice based architecture has been on the rise for years now. There are good number of reasons why developers prefer microservice based architecture over monolithic architcture. Microservices are an architectural and organizational approach to software development where software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. These services are owned by small, self-contained teams.

Your task here is to create a Library Management System using microservices, and solely on microservices. You can use any framework and language of your choice. Your application can contain multiple services and each of the services will have individual servers running on different ports. There could be multiple microservices for your application, implement a few of them. As an example of a microservice, let us assume that the database will be running on one port while your book service is on another, while the library service is on another, and so on.
