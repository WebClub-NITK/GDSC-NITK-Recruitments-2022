Firebase has been growing in popularity over the years, thanks to its features that offer a variety of services varying from acting as a database to store files and text, to serving as a real-time communcation server.

## Task ID: Progressive Web Application with OAuth

#### `Web dev`, `PWA`, `OAuth`

Mentors: [@Rashmith](https://github.com/rashmiths) (+91 6362402817), [@Ashwin901](https://github.com/Ashwin901) (+91 9035797138)

### Description

Progressive Web Application (PWA) is a type of website that can be installed on a device and provide an app-like experience. In this task you are expected to implement a simple web application that can be installed on a device. Also, the application should allow for the user to login with an existing account of theirs such as their Google/Facebook account via OAuth.

Optionally, you can also utilise some of the features PWAs make way for such as notifications, geolocation, file system, etc.

### Description
A landing page is a single web page that often forms the first digital impression of a product to a user. It contains all the information necessary to attract the user and convert it into a sale. It contains the 'Call To Action' and can make or break the deal.


Build a landing page for any business/product. Fetch the data using any of the below mentioned APIs (one or more APIs from any _one_ category). For instance, a cinema hall would use any of the entertainment APIs to show the movies it displays.

## Task ID: Regularise Stuff: CRON Jobs or DAGs
#### `Cloud` , `Backend`, `AWS`, `CRON jobs`, `Scheduling`

Mentors: [@Parth Mittal](https://github.com/mittal-parth) (`+91 9411327838`), [@Aditya R Rudra](https://github.com/adityaofficial10) (`+91 6260749212`)

Tag: `Medium - Hard`

### Description
We often require the need for a task to be repeated after regular intervals. This is a simple problem that arises in almost every application. There are solutions available, primarily CRON jobs. This can also be implemented using Directed Acyclic Graphs(DAGs).

Build a web backend using the language and framework of your choice that takes in a task description and schedules an email notification for the user, depending on the frequency specified by the user. You may use any of the two approaches specified above.

Do not try to come up with custom implementations of any scheduling mechanism. Instead go for the established solutions that are available.

### Useful resources:
These links will help you get to terms with some of the available solutions:
* AWS Eventbridge: CRON Jobs - https://amirmustafaofficial.medium.com/creating-cron-jobs-using-amazon-event-bridge-6fd6cfd6d0a2
* Github Actions: CRON Jobs - https://docs.getnacelle.com/deployment/scheduled-builds-github-actions.html
* Airflow DAGs: https://towardsdatascience.com/job-scheduling-with-apache-airflow-2-0-in-10-minutes-16d19f548a46

### Tips
1. You are not limited by any language or technology.
2. The primary focus is on the scheduling.
3. Bonus points for using Airflow or AWS.
4. Most of the solutions provide SDKs in many languages. Feel free to explore any of them.
